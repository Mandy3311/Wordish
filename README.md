# Wordish

This is a project to develop a simplified Wordle-like game! It consists of three phases, each building upon the previous one to create a fully functional web-based word game.

## Phase 1: Front-End User Interface
- Build the front-end user interface using HTML and CSS.
- Utilize Git and GitHub for version control.
- Create a visually appealing front-end.

## Phase 2: JavaScript Implementation
- Implement game functions using JavaScript.
- Add interactivity to the front end through DOM manipulation.
- Ensure robustness with basic input validation.

## Phase 3: Django Server-Side Integration
- Extend the project by integrating it with a Django server-side application.
- Handle game logic on the server.
- Gain hands-on experience with Django, a production-quality web framework written in Python.
