# Wordish

This is a project to develop a simplified Wordle-like game! It consists of three phases, each building upon the previous one to create a fully functional web-based word game.

## Phase 1: Front-End User Interface
- Build the front-end user interface using HTML and CSS.
- Utilize Git and GitHub for version control.
- Create a visually appealing front-end.

## Phase 1: Front-End User Interface
In this phase, we focus on building the front-end user interface for the Wordish game. The primary goal is to create an appealing and responsive interface using HTML and CSS. This phase provides an introduction to version control with Git and GitHub.

### Key Objectives:
- Utilize Git and GitHub for version control and homework submission.
- Practice incremental development with well-documented Git commits.
- Create a visually appealing front-end using HTML and CSS.

## Phase 2: JavaScript Implementation
Phase 2 involves implementing the game functions using JavaScript, running client-side in the web browser. You'll be adding interactivity and functionality to the static front end created in Phase 1.

### Key Objectives:
- Gain familiarity with client-side programming using JavaScript.
- Implement game functionality through DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Ensure robustness with basic input validation.

## Phase 3: Django Server-Side Integration
In the final phase, we extend the project by integrating it with a Django server-side application. The game will work similarly to Phase 2, but the game logic will be handled on the server, not in the browser.

### Key Objectives:
- Understand how requests are routed and processed in a typical MVC web application.
- Implement server-side routes in Django to handle game logic.
- Demonstrate data interactions between the client and server, including HTTP GET and POST requests.
- Perform thorough validation of HTTP request parameters.
- Gain hands-on experience with Django, a production-quality web framework written in Python.
